# Python_Pandas
Join me in the beginning process of learning python pandas for data manipulation and analysis =)



This project consists of a Google Colab notebook filling done concurrently with the classes of the course Python for Data Science: Functions, Packages and Pandas, taught by instructor Rodrigo Fernando Dias from Alura. 

In this project I learned how to install python and check its version and had one of my first contacts with the language. In it we import a database about a car store and manipulate it using pandas. 

This way I learned how to manipulate, create and iterate tuples, create and manipulate dictionaries, built-in function, data structures, creation, manipulation, iteration and querys of DataFrames. I also had an introduction to data processing.
