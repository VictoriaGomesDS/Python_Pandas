# Python_Pandas
Join me in the beginning process of learning python pandas for data manipulation and analysis =)

Next to it is a picture of a programming code and a panda in front of it.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102270053/179418718-856f6d75-43b4-4d36-8067-9bcddc348ce3.png)

This project consists of a Google Colab notebook filling done concurrently with the classes of the course Python for Data Science: Functions, Packages and Pandas, taught by instructor Rodrigo Fernando Dias from Alura. 

In this project I learned how to install python and check its version and had one of my first contacts with the language. In it we import a database about a car store and manipulate it using pandas. 

This way I learned how to manipulate, create and iterate tuples, create and manipulate dictionaries, built-in function, data structures, creation, manipulation, iteration and querys of DataFrames. I also had an introduction to data processing.

All this very well documented in the notebook above =)
